# socio-design-web

A web-based tool for Organizational network analysis (ONA).

Deployed at https://johannesoster.github.io/socio-design-web/

Under [socio-design.ipynb](/proof-of-concept/socio-design.ipynb) you can find a proof of concept for finding an optimal visualization of an adjacency matrix indicating social relationships within a group. This functionality should now be transferred to a web-based environment to enable interactivity.

### Tasks

- Implement Kamada Kawai as 2nd optimization algorithm as done in POF.
- Add ability for user to enter adjacency matrix of fixed size
- Add ability for user to adapt size of adjacency matrix
- Add "reoptimize" button to rerun optimization algorithms after user manually moved vertices
- Add "Cmd+Z" to undo an action
