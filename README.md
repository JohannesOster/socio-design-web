# socio-design

A web-based tool for Organizational network analysis (ONA).

Deployed at https://johannesoster.github.io/socio-design-web/

Under socio-design.ipynb you can find a proof of concept for finding an optimal visualization of an adjacency matrix indicating social relationships within a group. This functionality should now be transferred to a web-based environment to enable interactivity.
