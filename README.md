# socio-design-web

A web-based tool for Organizational network analysis (ONA).

Under [socio-design.ipynb](/proof-of-concept/socio-design.ipynb) you can find a proof of concept for finding an optimal visualization of an adjacency matrix indicating social relationships within a group. This functionality should now be transferred to a web-based environment to enable interactivity.
